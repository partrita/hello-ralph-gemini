# Guess the Number Game Requirements

1. **Language:** Python 3.
2. **Goal:** The program generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user tries to guess it.
3. **Feedback:**
   - If the guess is too high, print "Too high!"
   - If the guess is too low, print "Too low!"
   - If the guess is correct, print "You won!" and exit.
4. **Input:** The game should handle invalid inputs (like letters) gracefully without crashing.
